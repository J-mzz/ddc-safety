nontrivial_constraints reduces the number of faces of the consistency polytope.

The code in ddc_safety_b_red implements the nontrivial_constraints routine in
posing DDC with safety.

Lines 23, 53, and 57 perform the redundant face identification step and include
only nonredundant faces when forming the control certificate program.
